This repo is for [coverity](https://scan.coverity.com/) scans of KVIrc.

They have [limit](https://scan.coverity.com/faq#frequency) for number of scans
per week, so usual repo wouldn't work very well.

No pull requests are accepted here, all configuration is at .travis.yml
on [https://github.com/kvirc/KVIrc](main repo).
